# Solar System 
##### My first React project. This is a website for a solar energy company. The
website was created in the "One Page Scroll Site" convention. The React
Router Hash Links library was used here to support smooth traffic between
subpages. In the "Calculator" subpage, I implemented a simple calculator that
calculates how many kW should be installed to reduce the monthly cost of
electricity given by the user. AOS Animations Library was used for the scrolling
animation.


###  They may occur some problems with safari browser, it's caused by React Router hash links
