# Solar System 
##### This is my first project in React. This is one page scroll website using React Router hash links. I added smooth scroll library for cleaner surfing. In calculator page, you can calculate how many kW you need for your monthly energy consumption. AOS library was used for scroll animations.

###  They may occur some problems with safari browser, it's caused by React Router hash links
